# Bloom's Taxonomy Based Question Paper Generation

## Project Overview

This project aims to automate the creation of question papers by using Bloom's Taxonomy and machine learning techniques. The system helps educators generate questions across various cognitive levels, from basic recall to critical analysis, ensuring diverse and well-balanced assessments. The integration of machine learning algorithms allows for the automatic prediction of marks and categorization of questions based on cognitive complexity.

## Features

- **Bloom's Taxonomy Integration**: Generate questions based on cognitive levels (Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, Create).
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Uses algorithms like Linear Regression for mark prediction and Random Forest for Bloom's Taxonomy level prediction.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Allows educators to specify subject, grade level, difficulty, and topics covered.
- **Analytics**: Provides insights into student performance to help educators improve instructional strategies.


## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Django (Python)
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, Pandas
- **Web Development**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
